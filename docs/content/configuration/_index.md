## Database Configuration 🗄️

A Oracle Database 23ai is required to store the embedding vectors to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The ChatBot can be used without a configured database, but you will be unable to split/embed or experiment with RAG in the ChatBot.

For more information on configuring the database, please read about [Database Configuration](db_config/).
